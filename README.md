# Ro5_descriptor_calculation

Lipinski's rule of five is used to evaluate "druglikeness" i.e. whether a chemical compound has the properties to be an orally active drug in humans. Candidate drugs that conform to the RO5 tend to have lower attrition rates during clinical trials however, there are many exceptions; only about 50 % of orally administered new chemical entities actually obey the rules.

This simple script calculates Ro5 descriptors for a set of molecules then searches for "drug-like"  compounds within the set. Code was adapted from:  https://github.com/PatWalters/useful_rdkit_utils/blob/master/notebooks/demo_REOS.ipynb
